description: Raytracing is fascinating and this is my entry into that realm.  <a href="https://github.com/Mandalorian444/WeekendRayTracer" target="_blank">View this project on Github.</a>
notes:
    - There's a wonderful series called <a href="https://github.com/RayTracing/raytracing.github.io" target="_blank">Ray Tracing In One Weekend</a> that serves as a smooth intro to this field.  With this little project I am working my way through that series, adding some of my own flavor to it along the way.  So far you can render a test UV image (as seen above) and a basic random scene, as well as adjust some of the render settings such as image size and samples.
